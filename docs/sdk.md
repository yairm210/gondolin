# TypeScript SDK

This section contains the more detailed, programmatic documentation for the
`@earendil-works/gondolin` TypeScript SDK (VM lifecycle, network policy, VFS,
asset management, and development notes).

The most basic example involves spawning a VM and executing commands:

```ts
import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create();

// String form runs via `/bin/sh -lc "..."`
const result = await vm.exec("curl -sS -f https://example.com/");

console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
console.log("stdout:\n", result.stdout);
console.log("stderr:\n", result.stderr);

await vm.close();
```
## VM Lifecycle & Command Execution

When working with the SDK you always need to create a VM object and destroy it.  If
you don't, then the QEMU instance hangs around.

### Creating, Starting, and Closing

Most code should use the async factory, which also ensures guest assets are
available:

```ts
import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create({
  // set autoStart: false if you want to configure things before boot
  // autoStart: false,
});

// Optional: explicit start (VM.create defaults to autoStart: true)
await vm.start();

// ...use the VM...
await vm.close();
```

### `vm.exec()`

This is the most common of operations.  it returns an `ExecProcess` (a running
command handle) which is both:

- **Promise-like**: `await vm.exec(...)` yields an `ExecResult`
- **Stream-like**: when stdout/stderr are configured as `"pipe"`, it is an `AsyncIterable` for stdout and exposes `stdout`/`stderr` streams

There are two forms:

- `vm.exec("...")` (string): runs the command via a login shell, equivalent to:
  `vm.exec(["/bin/sh", "-lc", "..."])`
- `vm.exec([cmd, ...argv])` (array): executes an executable directly. **It does not search `$PATH`**, so `cmd` must be an **absolute path**.

If you want shell features (pipelines, `$VARS`, globbing, `$(...)`, etc.), use the string form (or call `/bin/sh` explicitly):

```ts
const result = await vm.exec("echo $HOME | wc -c");
console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
console.log("stdout:\n", result.stdout);
console.log("stderr:\n", result.stderr);
```

Buffered usage (most common):

```ts
const result = await vm.exec("echo hello; echo err >&2; exit 7");

console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode); // 7
console.log("ok:", result.ok);             // false
console.log("stdout:\n", result.stdout);  // "hello\n"
console.log("stderr:\n", result.stderr);  // "err\n"
```

#### What Is in `ExecResult`

An `ExecResult` is **always returned**, even on non-zero exit codes (non-zero
exit codes do *not* throw).  You typically check:

- `result.exitCode: number`: process exit code
- `result.signal?: number`: termination signal (if the guest reports one)
- `result.ok: boolean`: shorthand for `exitCode === 0`
- `result.stdout: string` / `result.stderr: string`: decoded using `options.encoding` (default: `utf-8`)
- `result.stdoutBuffer: Buffer` / `result.stderrBuffer: Buffer`: for binary output
- helpers: `result.json<T>()`, `result.lines()`

#### Streaming Output

You can stream output while the command runs:

```ts
const proc = vm.exec("for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; sleep 1; done", { stdout: "pipe" });

for await (const chunk of proc) {
  // default async iteration yields stdout chunks as strings
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}

const result = await proc;
console.log(result.exitCode);
```

Important detail: streaming output requires `stdout: "pipe"` (and `stderr: "pipe"` if you
want stderr).

When using `pipe`, Gondolin does **not** buffer stdout/stderr into the final
`ExecResult` (use the default buffered mode if you want captured output).

Backpressure: in streaming modes (`stdout: "pipe"` / `stderr: "pipe"` or a writable),
Gondolin uses a host<->guest credit window to keep buffered output bounded.
You can tune the window size with `windowBytes` (default: 256 KiB).

If you need both streaming *and* to keep a copy of output, capture it yourself
from the piped streams:

```ts
const proc = vm.exec(["/bin/echo", "hello"], { stdout: "pipe" });
let stdout = "";
proc.stdout!.on("data", (b) => (stdout += b.toString("utf-8")));

await proc;
console.log(stdout);
```

To stream both stdout and stderr with labels, use `proc.output()`:

```ts
for await (const { stream, text } of vm.exec("echo out; echo err >&2", { stdout: "pipe", stderr: "pipe" }).output()) {
  process.stdout.write(`[${stream}] ${text}`);
}
```

#### `proc.attach()`

`vm.exec()` returns an `ExecProcess`, which can be **attached** to a terminal (or any Node streams):

```ts
const proc = vm.exec(["/bin/bash", "-i"], {
  stdin: true,
  pty: true,
  stdout: "pipe",
  stderr: "pipe",
});

proc.attach(
  process.stdin as NodeJS.ReadStream,
  process.stdout as NodeJS.WriteStream,
  process.stderr as NodeJS.WriteStream,
);

const result = await proc;
console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
```

What `attach()` does:

- wires `stdin` -> guest process (requires `stdin: true`)
- forwards `stdout`/`stderr` to the provided writable streams when they are set to `"pipe"`
- if `stdout`/`stderr` are `"inherit"` (or a custom writable), output is already forwarded by the VM, and `attach()` only handles input/resize
- enables raw mode on TTY stdin, and forwards terminal resize events to the guest (only meaningful with `pty: true`)
- automatically cleans up listeners and restores raw mode when the process exits

Notes:

- `attach()` can only be called once per process.
- Don't simultaneously consume `proc.stdout` / async-iterate the process and call `attach()`; attaching will consume the pipe.

#### Avoiding Large Buffers

For commands that may produce a lot of output, set `buffer: false` (drops stdout/stderr):

```ts
const result = await vm.exec(["/bin/cat", "/some/huge/file"], { buffer: false });
console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);

// Or stream it with backpressure:
// const proc = vm.exec(["/bin/cat", "/some/huge/file"], { stdout: "pipe", buffer: false });
// for await (const chunk of proc) process.stdout.write(chunk);
```

You can still stream output by using `stdout: "pipe"` / `stderr: "pipe"`.
The resulting `ExecResult` will not include buffered stdout/stderr.

#### Cancellation

`ExecOptions.signal` can be used to stop waiting for a command:

```ts
const ac = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() => ac.abort(), 1000);

try {
  const result = await vm.exec(["/bin/sleep", "10"], { signal: ac.signal });
  console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
} catch (err) {
  // aborting rejects with "exec aborted"
  console.error(String(err));
}
```

Note: aborting currently rejects the local promise; it does not (yet) guarantee
that the guest process is terminated.

### `vm.shell()`

`vm.shell()` is a convenience wrapper around `vm.exec()` for interactive
sessions (PTY + stdin enabled), optionally attaching to the current terminal.

### `vm.readFile()`, `vm.readFileStream()`, `vm.writeFile()`, and `vm.deleteFile()`

These helpers provide host-driven file operations inside the guest.  These allow
file systme access also to non VFS mounts which can be accessed on the node side
directly.

```ts
import { Readable } from "node:stream";

// Read text
const osRelease = await vm.readFile("/etc/os-release", { encoding: "utf-8" });

// Stream-read a large file
const stream = await vm.readFileStream("/var/log/messages");
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}

// Write text (overwrites existing file)
await vm.writeFile("/tmp/hello.txt", "hello from host\n");

// Stream-write from a Node readable
await vm.writeFile("/tmp/payload.bin", Readable.from([
  Buffer.from([0xde, 0xad]),
  Buffer.from([0xbe, 0xef]),
]));

// Delete file
await vm.deleteFile("/tmp/hello.txt");

// Delete recursively / ignore missing path
await vm.deleteFile("/tmp/some-dir", { recursive: true, force: true });
```

Notes:

- `readFile()` reads any path visible in the **running guest filesystem** (including rootfs paths under `/`)
- `readFile()` returns a `Buffer` by default; pass `encoding` to get a `string`
- `readFileStream()` streams file bytes as a Node readable stream
- `writeFile()` truncates existing files before writing and accepts `string`, `Buffer`, `Uint8Array`, `Readable`, or `AsyncIterable`
- `deleteFile()` supports `force` and `recursive`

### `vm.enableSsh()`

For workflows that prefer SSH tooling (scp/rsync/ssh port forwards), you can
start an `sshd` inside the guest and expose it via a host-local TCP forwarder:

```ts
const access = await vm.enableSsh();
console.log(access.command); // ready-to-run ssh command

// ...
await access.close();
```

See also: [SSH access](./ssh.md).

### `vm.enableIngress()`

You can expose HTTP servers running inside the guest VM to the host machine.
This feature is called "ingress" internally.

When you call `vm.enableIngress()`:

- the host starts a local HTTP gateway (default: `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>`)
- requests are routed based on `/etc/gondolin/listeners` inside the guest

Ingress requires the default `/etc/gondolin` mount. If you disable VFS entirely
(`vfs: null`) or override `/etc/gondolin` with a custom mount, `enableIngress()`
will fail.

Minimal example:

```ts
import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create();

const ingress = await vm.enableIngress({
  listenHost: "127.0.0.1",
  listenPort: 0, // 0 picks an ephemeral port
});

console.log("Ingress:", ingress.url);

// Route all requests to the guest server on port 8000
vm.setIngressRoutes([{ prefix: "/", port: 8000, stripPrefix: true }]);

// Start a server inside the guest
// NOTE: the guest currently executes one command at a time; a long-running
// vm.exec() (like a server) will block additional exec requests.
const server = vm.exec(["/bin/sh", "-lc", "python -m http.server 8000"], {
  buffer: false,
  stdout: "inherit",
  stderr: "inherit",
});

// Now you can reach the guest service from the host at ingress.url
// ...

await ingress.close();
await vm.close();
```

#### Ingress Hooks

`enableIngress()` can install **host-side hook points** on the ingress gateway.
This is useful for:

- allow/deny decisions based on client IP / path / route
- rewriting upstream target paths (or headers)
- adding/removing response headers
- optionally buffering responses so you can rewrite bodies

Hooks are configured via `enableIngress({ hooks: ... })`:

- `hooks.isAllowed(info) -> boolean`: return `false` to deny (default response: `403 forbidden`)
  - for a custom deny response, throw `new IngressRequestBlockedError(...)`
- `hooks.onRequest(request) -> patch`: rewrite headers and/or upstream target
  - can also enable per-request response buffering via `bufferResponseBody: true`
- `hooks.onResponse(response, request) -> patch`: rewrite status/headers and optionally replace the body

Streaming vs buffering:

- by default, responses are streamed directly (no buffering)
- if you enable buffering (either globally via `enableIngress({ bufferResponseBody: true })` or per-request via `onRequest()`), the full upstream response body is buffered before `onResponse()` runs and provided as `response.body`

Header patch semantics:

- set a header to a `string`/`string[]` to set/overwrite it
- set a header to `null` to delete it

Example:

```ts
import { IngressRequestBlockedError, VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create();

await vm.enableIngress({
  hooks: {
    isAllowed: ({ clientIp, path }) => {
      if (path.startsWith("/admin")) {
        throw new IngressRequestBlockedError(
          `admin blocked for ${clientIp}`,
          403,
          "Forbidden",
          "nope\n"
        );
      }
      return true;
    },

    onRequest: (req) => ({
      // Rewrite /api/* -> /* inside the guest
      backendTarget: req.backendTarget.startsWith("/api/") ? req.backendTarget.slice(4) : req.backendTarget,
      headers: { "x-added": "1", "x-remove": null },

      // Only buffer responses we plan to inspect/modify
      bufferResponseBody: req.backendTarget.endsWith(".json"),
      maxBufferedResponseBodyBytes: 8 * 1024 * 1024,
    }),

    onResponse: (res) => ({
      headers: { "x-ingress": "1" },
      body: res.body ? Buffer.from(res.body.toString("utf8").toUpperCase()) : undefined,
    }),
  },
});
```

You can read or replace the current routing table programmatically:

- `vm.getIngressRoutes()`
- `vm.setIngressRoutes(routes)`

See also: [Ingress](./ingress.md).

## Network Policy

The network stack only allows HTTP and TLS traffic. TCP flows are classified and
non-HTTP traffic is dropped. Requests are intercepted and replayed via `fetch`
on the host side, enabling:

- Host allowlists with wildcard support
- Request/response hooks for logging and modification
- Secret injection without exposing credentials to the guest
- DNS rebinding protection

```ts
import { createHttpHooks } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const { httpHooks, env } = createHttpHooks({
  allowedHosts: ["api.example.com", "*.github.com"],
  secrets: {
    API_KEY: { hosts: ["api.example.com"], value: process.env.API_KEY! },
  },
  blockInternalRanges: true, // default: true
  isRequestAllowed: (req) => req.method !== "DELETE",
  isIpAllowed: ({ ip }) => !ip.startsWith("203.0.113."),
  onRequest: async (req) => {
    console.log(req.url);
    return req;
  },
  onResponse: async (res, req) => {
    console.log(req.url, res.status);
    return res;
  },
});
```

### SSH egress (optional)

You can optionally allow outbound SSH (default port `22`, with non-standard ports enabled by allowlisting `HOST:PORT`) from the guest to an allowlist.
This is useful for git-over-SSH (e.g. cloning private repos) without granting the
guest arbitrary TCP access.

```ts
import os from "node:os";
import path from "node:path";

import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create({
  dns: {
    mode: "synthetic",
    syntheticHostMapping: "per-host",
  },
  ssh: {
    allowedHosts: ["github.com"],

    // Non-standard ports can be allowlisted as "HOST:PORT" (e.g. "ssh.github.com:443")

    // Authenticate upstream using host ssh-agent OR a configured private key
    agent: process.env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK,
    // credentials: { "github.com": { username: "git", privateKey: "..." } },

    // Verify upstream host keys (recommended)
    knownHostsFile: path.join(os.homedir(), ".ssh", "known_hosts"),

    // Optional: allow/deny individual ssh exec requests (useful for git repo filtering)
    // execPolicy: (req) => ({ allow: true }),

    // Optional safety knobs:
    // maxUpstreamConnectionsPerTcpSession: 4,
    // maxUpstreamConnectionsTotal: 64,
    // upstreamReadyTimeoutMs: 15_000,
  },
});
```

Notes:

- SSH egress is proxied by the host and intentionally limited to non-interactive
  `exec` usage (no shells, no subsystems like `sftp`).
- See: [SSH](./ssh.md) and [Network stack](./network.md).

Notable consequences:

- Secret placeholders are substituted in request headers by default (including Basic auth token decoding/re-encoding).
  - For full behavior, caveats, and best practices, see [Secrets Handling](./secrets.md).
- ICMP echo requests in the guest "work", but are synthetic (you can ping any address).
- HTTP redirects are resolved on the host and hidden from the guest (the guest only
  sees the final response), so redirects cannot escape the allowlist.
- WebSockets are supported via HTTP/1.1 Upgrade, but after the `101` response the connection becomes an opaque tunnel (only the handshake is hookable).
  - Disable egress WebSockets via `VM.create({ allowWebSockets: false })` (or `sandbox.allowWebSockets: false`).
  - Disable ingress WebSockets via `vm.enableIngress({ allowWebSockets: false })`.
- DNS is available in multiple modes:

    - `synthetic` (default): no upstream DNS, returns synthetic answers
    - `trusted`: forwards queries only to trusted host resolvers (prevents using
      UDP/53 as arbitrary UDP transport to arbitrary destination IPs)

      - Note: trusted upstream resolvers are currently **IPv4-only**; if none are configured/found, VM creation fails.

    - `open`: forwards UDP/53 to the destination IP the guest targeted

- Even though the guest does DNS resolutions, they're largely disregarded for
  policy; the host enforces policy against the HTTP `Host` header and does its own
  resolution to prevent DNS rebinding attacks.

For deeper conceptual background, see [Network stack](./network.md).

## VFS Providers

Gondolin can mount host-backed paths into the guest via programmable VFS
providers.

See [VFS Providers](./vfs.md) for the full provider reference and common
recipes (blocking `/.env`, hiding `node_modules`, read-only mounts, hooks, and
more).

Minimal example:

```ts
import { VM, RealFSProvider, MemoryProvider } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create({
  vfs: {
    mounts: {
      "/workspace": new RealFSProvider("/host/workspace"),
      "/scratch": new MemoryProvider(),
    },
  },
});
```

## Image Management

Guest images (kernel, initramfs, rootfs) are automatically downloaded from
GitHub releases on first use. The default cache location is `~/.cache/gondolin/`.

Override the cache location:

```bash
export GONDOLIN_GUEST_DIR=/path/to/assets
```

Check asset status programmatically:

```ts
import {
  hasGuestAssets,
  ensureGuestAssets,
  getAssetDirectory,
} from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

console.log("Assets available:", hasGuestAssets());
console.log("Asset directory:", getAssetDirectory());

// Download if needed
const assets = await ensureGuestAssets();
console.log("Kernel:", assets.kernelPath);
```

To build custom image see the documentation is here: [Building Custom Images](./custom-images.md).

## Disk checkpoints (qcow2)

Gondolin supports **disk-only checkpoints** of the VM root filesystem.

A checkpoint captures the VM's writable disk state and can be resumed cheaply
using qcow2 backing files.

See also: [Snapshots](./snapshots.md).


```ts
import path from "node:path";

import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const base = await VM.create();

// Install packages / write to the root filesystem...
await base.exec("apk add git");
await base.exec("echo hello > /etc/my-base-marker");

// Note: must be an absolute path
const checkpointPath = path.resolve("./dev-base.qcow2");
const checkpoint = await base.checkpoint(checkpointPath);

const task1 = await checkpoint.resume();
const task2 = await checkpoint.resume();

// Both VMs start from the same disk state and diverge independently
await task1.close();
await task2.close();

checkpoint.delete();
```

Notes:

- This is **disk-only** (no in-VM RAM/process restore)
- The checkpoint is a single `.qcow2` file; metadata is stored as a JSON trailer
  (reload with `VmCheckpoint.load(checkpointPath)`)
- Checkpoints require guest assets with a `manifest.json` that includes a
  deterministic `buildId` (older assets without `buildId` cannot be snapshotted)
- Some guest paths are tmpfs-backed by design (eg. `/root`, `/tmp`, `/var/log`);
  writes under those paths are not part of disk checkpoints

Use the custom assets programmatically by pointing `sandbox.imagePath` at the
asset directory:

```ts
import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create({
  sandbox: {
    imagePath: "./my-assets",
  },
});

const result = await vm.exec("uname -a");
console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
console.log("stdout:\n", result.stdout);
console.log("stderr:\n", result.stderr);

await vm.close();
```

## Debug Logging

See [Debug Logging](./debug.md).
